                    It measured 22×22 — under WCAG 2.2 AA's 24×24 floor and
                    less than a quarter of the 44×44 target the platform HIGs
                    ask for. The hit area is now 44×44 while the glyph stays
                    at 22, so nothing about the chrome looks heavier; the
                    negative margin keeps the icon optically flush with the

                    this trigger was 220px wide, which put the account menu's
                    right edge at 420px against a 390px viewport — the button
                    was entirely off-canvas and unreachable. On a phone with
                    more than one org a user could not sign out or switch org
                    at all.

                    It survived every sweep this session because the demo box
                    seeds exactly ONE organisation and this whole block only
                    renders when there is more than one, so the measurement
                    pass was structurally blind to it. Reproduced by rewriting
                    the `/api/auth/me` envelope to carry two orgs, one with a
                    deliberately long name; `body{overflow-x:hidden}` means
                    the page never scrolls sideways to reveal it, so only
                    per-element rects show it at all.

                    Below sm the trigger collapses to the icon alone — 220px
                    down to 44px — which is the same trade the wordmark
                    already makes here (`hideWordBelowSm`). The name has not
                    vanished: it is the button's accessible name, and the menu
                    it opens now marks the active org with a check, which it
                    did not before and which the icon-only state makes
                    necessary rather than merely nice. From sm up the label
                    returns, still truncated. */}
