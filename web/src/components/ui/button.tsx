// The focus ring is RED and it is `ring-offset-background`, not a bare ring.
// That offset is load-bearing rather than decorative: the primary button is
// ITSELF red, so a red ring drawn flush against it would be invisible on the
// one control the keyboard lands on most. The page-coloured gap is what makes
// the indicator readable on a red fill and on paper alike.
//
// Every fill below carries an ink measured against it in contrast.test.js.
// The pairing is also the product's danger affordance: a RED fill with INK
// type is the primary action, a CRIMSON fill with WHITE type destroys
// something. Two red buttons, never mistakable, even for someone who reads
// the two hues as one colour.

/**
 * `loading` is a prop rather than something each page assembles, because the
 * pages that needed it were each getting a different two thirds of it right.
 * Saving an event spun the Save icon but left the button clickable-looking;
 * other submits swapped in a spinner and dropped the label, so the control
 * changed width mid-click and the next button moved under the cursor. None of
 * them told a screen reader anything at all.
 *
 * One prop, four guarantees: the button is genuinely `disabled` (a second
 * click cannot re-submit), it is `aria-busy` so the state is announced and
 * not merely drawn, the LABEL STAYS so the control keeps its width and the
 * user keeps their reading, and the spinner is `motion-safe` — under
 * prefers-reduced-motion it renders as a static glyph rather than as a
 * near-instant flicker, matching how Skeleton behaves.
 *
 * Ignored under `asChild`: Slot renders a single child element and merges
 * props onto it, so injecting a second element here would throw. A composed
 * trigger that needs a busy state should render <Button loading> directly.
