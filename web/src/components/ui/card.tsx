/**
 * Card is the app's raised surface: a bordered, rounded panel on `--card`.
 *
 * `interactive` is for a card that is itself the control — a whole tile you
 * click to open an event. It is a prop rather than a class every caller
 * assembles because the two call sites that needed it had already drifted
 * apart: one used `hover:-translate-y-1 hover:shadow-xl`, the other
 * `hover:shadow-md`, and neither `shadow-xl` nor `shadow-md` is a step on
 * this product's elevation ramp (`soft` / `elevated` / `floating`, defined
 * per theme in index.css). It also carries the parts that are easy to forget
 * and impossible to see: a focus-visible ring, so the tile is reachable by
 * keyboard at all, and `motion-reduce`, so the lift is not forced on someone
 * who asked for no motion.
 *
 * @param {object} props
 * @param {boolean} [props.interactive] the whole card is a control

/**
 * CardHeader holds the card's title block and, optionally, the controls that
 * act on the card.
 *
 * # Why `actions` exists
 *
 * It is the fix for a real defect. `pages/organizers/events/event/details.tsx`
 * renders `<Card className="relative">` with a `<div className="absolute
 * right-4 top-4">` holding Save and Delete, so both controls float on top of
 * the first thing inside the card — which is the "Cover image" section
 * heading. The buttons overlap live content, at every width, in both themes.
 *
 * That was invited from here. CardHeader was `flex flex-col space-y-1.5`: a
 * vertical stack and nothing else. A card whose header needs a title on the
 * left and a control on the right had NO affordance, so every page invented
 * one. Four did it four ways —
 * `flex flex-row items-center justify-between`,
 * `flex flex-row items-start justify-between gap-3 space-y-0`,
 * `flex flex-col gap-4 sm:flex-row sm:items-center sm:justify-between` —
 * and the one that could not get it to work took the controls out of flow
 * instead. A missing affordance does not stop anybody; it only decides how
 * badly the workaround goes.
 *
 * So the slot exists, and it lays out IN FLOW. Nothing here is absolutely
 * positioned, which is what makes overlap structurally unavailable rather
 * than merely discouraged: the actions occupy their own track, the title
 * column is `min-w-0` so a long title truncates instead of shoving the
 * buttons out of the card, and `flex-wrap` over a `basis-64` title column
 * drops the actions onto their own line on a narrow screen rather than
 * crushing them. On a 390px phone that is the difference between two
 * reachable buttons and two slivers.
 *
 * When `actions` is not passed this renders exactly what it always did — one
 * flex column — so none of the existing call sites moves.
 *
 * @param {object} props
 * @param {React.ReactNode} [props.actions] controls acting on this card
