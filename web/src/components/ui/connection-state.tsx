// How Cackle talks about the network.
//
// This component exists to enforce one product decision in code: **a gate with
// no network is not in an error state.** It is the product working as designed.
// A ticket is a signed capability; the gate verifies it against a key ring it
// already has; the server's opinion is not part of the decision. Rendering that
// situation in a warning colour with a broken-cloud icon — which is what almost
// every offline-capable app does — teaches the operator to distrust exactly the
// property they are relying on, and to go looking for a fix at the worst
// possible moment.
//
// So: offline is NEUTRAL and it says what it is doing. Nothing here uses the
// warning or destructive tokens, and the copy never apologises.
//
// The genuinely notable state is the inverse — scans waiting to sync — and even
// that is information, not an error. Those scans are safe on the device and
// have already done their job at the door; syncing is how they reach the
// cross-gate reconciliation report later.
