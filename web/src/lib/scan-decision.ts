// lib/scan-decision.js
//
// The decision a gate makes about one presented ticket.
//
// This is lifted out of `use-scan-engine.ts` unchanged in behaviour, for one
// reason: it is the most consequential logic in the product and it was only
// reachable through a React hook, a camera and IndexedDB. Nothing that decides
// whether a person walks through a door should be that hard to test. Here it
// is an ordinary async function with its two effects injected, so every branch
// — including the ones that only happen when storage is broken — is covered by
// `scan-decision.test.js` under plain `node --test`.
//
// # What this mirrors
//
// Go's `scan.DecideWithBundle` (internal/scan/admission.go). The ORDER of the
// checks below is part of the contract, not an implementation detail, and it
// matches that function step for step.
//
// # What it does NOT do
//
// It does not prevent a cross-gate double-scan, and it cannot. Two gates
// partitioned from each other have no way to coordinate, so the same ticket
// presented at both IS admitted at both. What narrows the window is a fresher
// bundle (`admittedIndex` below); what finds what still slipped through is
// GET /api/events/{id}/admission-conflicts, after the fact. See
// docs/OFFLINE-GATES.md.
//
// # Fail closed
//
// Where this function cannot get an answer it refuses. A dedupe lookup that
// throws yields `invalid`, never `admitted` — refusing a legitimate guest is
// recoverable by a human at the door, and silently admitting a duplicate
// because storage was broken is not.

 * real Ed25519 verifier and the real IndexedDB lookup while a test supplies
 * fakes — including fakes that throw, which is how the fail-closed paths get
 * covered at all.
 *
 * A note on what is returned when a ticket is refused: an `invalid` verdict
 * carries `ticketId: null` even when a ticket id was parsed out of the token.
 * That is deliberate and matches the Go side — an id from a token that failed
 * verification is an unauthenticated string, and recording it would put
 * attacker-chosen data in the admission log.
