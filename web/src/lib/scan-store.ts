// --- Batch order ------------------------------------------------------------
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. The server applies an uploaded batch IN ARRAY ORDER
// (internal/httpapi/scan_handlers.go, dbSyncSink.Apply): the first 'admitted'
// claim it sees for a ticket keeps 'admitted', and every later claim for that
// same ticket is rewritten to 'duplicate' with the device's own verdict kept in
// reported_result. Batch order is therefore the winner rule for a contested
// ticket, and it must not be an accident.
//
// It was an accident. Admissions are keyed on a random UUID v4 and read back
// through `getAllFromIndex('by_event', ...)`, and IndexedDB returns index
// results ordered by index key and then by PRIMARY key — so the batch a gate
// uploaded was ordered by a random number. Two scans a minute apart could
// arrive in either order, every upload rolling the dice again.
//
// WHICH FIELD. `seq` — a local counter assigned when the scan is written,
// taken from the highest seq already in the store rather than from any clock.
// The alternative was `scanned_at`, and it is rejected for three reasons that
// bite in the order given:
//
//  1. A gate device's clock is not monotonic. An NTP correction, or an
//     operator fixing the time mid-shift, stamps a LATER scan with an EARLIER
//     scanned_at, and any order that trusts the column walks backwards with it.
//  2. Timestamps tie. Two scans inside one clock tick have no order at all
//     under a timestamp comparison, and a stable sort then silently falls back
//     to whatever IndexedDB happened to hand over — the random order again.
//  3. THE THREAT MODEL. scanned_at is the wall clock of the device at the
//     door, and the device controls it. Ordering the batch on it hands a phone
//     with a skewed — or deliberately backdated — clock a lever over which
//     gate wins a contested ticket: set the clock back, and your claims sort
//     to the front of your own upload. `seq` is assigned by this store at
//     enqueue time, cannot be moved by changing the clock, and can only
//     increase. scanned_at stays on the row, unchanged, as a diagnostic and as
//     the sync idempotency key — it is simply not an order.
//
// This mirrors internal/scan's SQLiteQueue.Pending, which orders by rowid for
// the same three reasons, so the reference queue and the queue that actually
// runs on the hardware answer the same way.
//
// WHAT THIS IS NOT. Making the batch order deterministic decides which of ONE
// device's claims competes first. It changes nothing about two gates that were
// offline from each other: a cross-gate double-scan is still DETECTED, never
// PREVENTED, because two doors that cannot see each other cannot agree at the
// moment of the scan. See docs/OFFLINE-GATES.md.
