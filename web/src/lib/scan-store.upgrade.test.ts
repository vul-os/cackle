// What happens to scans already queued on a device in the field.
//
// The upload order fix adds a `seq` column and a `by_seq` index, which means a
// database version bump — and there are phones out there right now holding
// unsynced admissions written under version 1, with no seq on them. Losing
// those is losing a record of people who were let through a door. Reordering
// them into nonsense is quieter and nearly as bad: the server decides a
// contested ticket by the order the batch arrives in.
//
// So this file opens a genuine version-1 database, populates it the way a
// gate would have, and then hands it to the real store — which upgrades it —
// and checks what came out the other side.
//
// It lives apart from scan-store.test.js because `node --test` runs each file
// in its own process, and the seeding has to happen before scan-store.js opens
// its (module-scoped, cached) connection. Sharing a process would mean racing
// that cache.
//
// The single edit that turns the assertions below red is removing the
// `oldVersion < 2` backfill from scan-store.js's upgrade callback.
