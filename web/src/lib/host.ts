/**
 * The `host` envelope on `GET /api/events`, turned into the words and the
 * decisions a page needs.
 *
 * # Why this file exists
 *
 * Cackle is self-hosted. Somebody installed it on their own machine to sell
 * tickets to their own events. A page headed "Browse all events" describes a
 * marketplace with everybody's events in it, and there is no such thing —
 * there is one box, belonging to one operator, with their events on it. The
 * listing API now says whose events it is returning (see
 * internal/httpapi/host_scope.go); this is the one place the app turns that
 * into copy, so the answer cannot drift page to page.
 *
 * Two rules are enforced here rather than left to each caller:
 *
 *  1. **A name is never invented.** If the operator has not named their host
 *     (`CACKLE_HOST_NAME`, or the organisation's own name under `single`
 *     scope), the heading carries no name at all. It does not fall back to
 *     "Cackle", to the hostname, or to anything else. The page belongs to a
 *     person; naming it for them would be a small lie on the most prominent
 *     line of the site.
 *  2. **A single-organisation box is never dressed up as a directory.**
 *     `multi_org` is the only switch for per-event organisation labels, and
 *     it comes from the host itself, not from counting the events currently
 *     on screen — a search that happens to match one organisation must not
 *     make a box present as a single venue.
 *
 * Every function tolerates a missing or malformed envelope by degrading to
 * the honest, name-free, label-free single-tenant presentation, so an older
 * server or a failed request can never produce marketplace copy.
 *
 * The envelope arrives over the wire, so nothing in it is trusted at its
 * declared type — every field below is `unknown` and narrowed by hand at the
 * point of use, exactly as the runtime checks already did before this file
 * had types.

/**
 * True when this host displays BORROWED LISTINGS — events belonging to
 * another organiser, which this box pulled from a publisher its operator
 * enrolled by hand.
 *
 * Two switches stand between an operator and a borrowed listing on their
 * front page, and they answer two different questions:
 *
 *  1. Per publisher, on the server: does this box PULL that organiser's
 *     programme at all? (`feed_subscribe`, off until the operator says so.)
 *  2. This one: is what was pulled shown to the PUBLIC? That is
 *     `CACKLE_HOST_SCOPE=peers`, and the envelope carries the answer as
 *     `peers_included`.
 *
 * Both are off by default, so an operator who has enrolled an organiser and
 * fetched their events still shows nobody else's programme on their own front
 * page until they ask for it. Reading someone's feed and publishing it are
 * separate decisions; this is the second one.
 *
 * Strictly `=== true`. A missing envelope, an older server that never sends
 * the field, a failed request, a truthy-but-not-true value — every one of them
 * resolves to NOT showing another organiser's events on this operator's page.
 * The unsafe direction here is showing something the operator did not publish,
 * so absence of an answer is never taken as yes.
