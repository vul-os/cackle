// The order a gate uploads its offline scan queue in.
//
// This is the queue that actually runs. Every phone at every door records
// scans into this IndexedDB store while the venue has no network, and
// `getPendingSync` produces the array that becomes POST /api/scan/sync's
// `admissions` body. The server (internal/httpapi/scan_handlers.go,
// dbSyncSink.Apply) walks that array IN ORDER and the FIRST 'admitted' claim
// for a ticket is the one that keeps 'admitted'; every later claim for the
// same ticket is rewritten to 'duplicate' with the device's own verdict
// preserved in reported_result. So the order this file pins down is the order
// in which a partitioned gate's claims compete for a contested ticket.
//
// Nothing here is stubbed that matters. `fake-indexeddb` is a real
// implementation of the IndexedDB specification, so `getAllFromIndex` sorts
// exactly the way Chrome and Safari sort: by index key, and then by PRIMARY
// key. That second clause is the whole defect — the primary key is a random
// UUID v4 — and modelling it by hand would have meant testing my own model of
// the bug rather than the bug.
//
// Determinism, since the defect is probabilistic:
//   * `withScriptedIDs` replaces crypto.randomUUID with a fixed script whose
//     ids DESCEND lexicographically as the scans ASCEND chronologically, so
//     primary-key order is the exact reverse of the right answer. There is no
//     ordering of a random draw involved: it fails, or the ordering is real.
//   * `TestUploadOrder_ManyRecordsRealUUIDs` does the same over 60 genuinely
//     random ids, where passing by luck is 1/60! — a backstop in case the
//     scripted ids ever stopped being representative.
