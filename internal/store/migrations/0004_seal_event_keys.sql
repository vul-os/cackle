-- Encrypt event signing keys at rest.
--
-- What was wrong
-- ──────────────
-- `event_keys.private_key` was a PLAINTEXT BLOB in the SQLite file. Every
-- event's Ed25519 issuer private key sat in the clear, in the one file an
-- operator is told to back up. Whoever obtained a copy could mint tickets
-- that verify perfectly for every event in it, forever, and no gate could
-- tell — the forgery carries a real signature from the real key. On a cloud
-- node that is one over-broad backup, one snapshot of a decommissioned
-- volume, or one misconfigured static-file route away.
--
-- This migration moves the private half under envelope encryption keyed by
-- material the operator supplies at boot (passphrase or keyfile) and which is
-- never stored in the database. See internal/store/keyvault.
--
-- Two-phase, and why
-- ──────────────────
-- Re-encrypting existing rows is not expressible in SQL — it needs Argon2id
-- and an AEAD. So this file does only the SCHEMA half, leaving each existing
-- row's plaintext parked in `legacy_private_key`, and the DATA half runs in
-- Go: store.SealLegacyEventKeys, invoked from cmd/cackle at boot once the
-- vault is unlocked. That function is idempotent (it only touches rows where
-- legacy_private_key IS NOT NULL) and it NULLs the plaintext in the same
-- transaction that writes the ciphertext, so a crash mid-migration can leave
-- a row sealed or unsealed but never both and never neither.
--
-- If a database still has legacy rows and no key material is configured,
-- cmd/cackle REFUSES TO START and says what to set. It does not half-migrate,
-- and it does not keep serving from plaintext.
--
-- The CHECK constraint is the load-bearing part
-- ────────────────────────────────────────────
-- Exactly one of {sealed, legacy} must be present on every row. That makes
-- three bad states unrepresentable rather than merely unlikely:
--
--   * a sealed row that ALSO still carries plaintext (a migration that
--     "encrypted" the key and forgot to remove the original — the failure
--     mode this whole exercise exists to prevent),
--   * a row with neither, i.e. an event whose key silently vanished,
--   * a row with ciphertext but no nonce, which would be undecryptable.
--
-- After store.SealLegacyEventKeys has run there is no row with a non-NULL
-- legacy_private_key, and the insert path in internal/store/event_keys.go has
-- no code that writes that column at all — it is only ever read and cleared.
--
-- Residue, stated honestly
-- ────────────────────────
-- Rewriting the table frees the pages the old plaintext lived on; freed pages
-- are not scrubbed. store.SealLegacyEventKeys therefore checkpoints the WAL
-- and VACUUMs after committing, which rebuilds the file without them. What
-- that CANNOT do is reach copies that already left: every backup, snapshot
-- and replica taken before this migration still contains plaintext keys.
-- Treat them as key material — see docs/SELF-HOSTING.md.
